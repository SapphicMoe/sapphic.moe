### Who?

Hi there! We're the **Sapphic Angels** system. We're computer science students at [Almaty Management University][almau] in Kazakhstan, specializing in Software Engineering.  

We used to go by a lot of names before. You might recognize the usernames **solely** or **solelychloe** before we were plural.

We have a fascination for anything related to system administration and we love to dabble with anything related to TypeScript, Nix, and Astro. 
And as hobbyist sysadmins, we self-host software for our specialized needs.

Due to our impaired eyesight, it's our mission to strive for accessibility where possible! We want to start by providing alt text where possible for our services. For example, the images that you see in our articles all have alt text in them.
